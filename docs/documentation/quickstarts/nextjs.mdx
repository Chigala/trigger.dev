This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Next.js project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-next-app` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Trigger.dev works with either the Pages or App Router configuration.

</Accordion>

## Create a Trigger.dev account

You can either:

- Use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev).
- Or [self-host](/documentation/guides/self-hosting) the service.

### Create your first project

Once you've created an account, follow the steps in the app to:

1. Complete your account details.
2. Create your first Organization and Project.

### Getting an API key

1. Go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your project.
   ![Go to the Environments & API Keys page ](/images/environments-link.png)

2. Copy the `DEV` **SERVER** API key.
   ![API Keys](/images/api-keys.png)

## Run the CLI `init` command

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing Next.js project, setup a route and give you an example file.

In a terminal window run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

It will ask you a few questions

1. Are you using the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [self-hosting](/documentation/guides/self-hosting)?
2. Enter your development API key. Enter the key you copied earlier.
3. Enter a unique ID for your endpoint (you can just use the default by hitting enter)


### Add the `TriggerProvider` component

The [TriggerProvider](/sdk/react/triggerprovider) component is a React Context Provider that will make the Trigger API client available to all child components.

Generally you'll want to add this to the root of your app, so that it's available everywhere. However, you can add it lower in the hierarchy but it must be above any of the hooks.

```tsx app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <TriggerProvider publicApiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_API_KEY!}>
          {children}
        </TriggerProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Add hooks to your components

There are three hooks that you can use to show statuses:

- [useEventDetails](/sdk/react/useeventdetails): get the details of a specific event
- [useRunDetails](/sdk/react/userundetails): get the details of a specific Run
- [useEventRunDetails](/sdk/react/useeventrundetails): get the details of a Run triggered from a specific event

All of these hooks will automatically refresh your components as the state of your Runs or events change.

#### a. useEventDetails

The `useEventDetails` hook will get the details of a specific event. You can use this to show the status of a specific event.

<Snippet file="how-to-get-event-id.mdx" />

This component will show the details of an event and the overall status of Runs that were triggered by the event:

```tsx
import { useEventDetails } from "@trigger.dev/react";

export default function EventDetails({ eventId }: { eventId: string }) {
  const { data, error } = useEventDetails(eventId);

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>Runs: {data.runs?.length}</p>
      <div>
        {data.runs?.map((run) => (
          <div key={run.id}>
            <p>
              Run {run.id}: {run.status}
            </p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### b. useRunDetails

The `useRunDetails` hook will get the details of a specific Run. You can use this to show the status of a specific Run.

<Accordion title="How do I get a Run id?">
  You can call [client.getRuns()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/getruns) with a Job id to get a
  list of the most recent Runs for that Job. You can then pass that run id to your frontend to use
  in the hook.
</Accordion>

This component will show the details of a Run and the status of each task in the Run:

```tsx
import { useRunDetails } from "@trigger.dev/react";

export default function RunDetails({ runId }: { runId: string }) {
  const { data, error } = useRunDetails(runId);

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Run {data.id}</h1>
      <p>Status: {data.status}</p>
      <div>
        {data.tasks?.map((task) => (
          <div key={task.id}>
            <p>
              Task {task.id}: {task.status}
            </p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### c. useEventRunDetails

The `useEventRunDetails` hook will get the details of a specific Run that was triggered by a specific event. You can use this to show the status of a specific Run.

<Snippet file="how-to-get-event-id.mdx" />

This component will show the details of a Run and the status of each task in the Run:

```tsx
import { useEventRunDetails } from "@trigger.dev/react";

export default function EventRunDetails({ eventId }: { eventId: string }) {
  const { data, error } = useEventRunDetails(eventId);

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Run {data.id}</h1>
      <p>Status: {data.status}</p>
      <div>
        {data.tasks?.map((task) => (
          <div key={task.id}>
            <p>
              Task {task.id}: {task.status}
            </p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Info >For Next.Js Page Router 13.1 onwards, Add this to your next.config.js file</Info>
```ts next.config.js
 const nextConfig = {
  transpilePackages: ["@trigger.dev/react"],
};

module.exports = nextConfig;

```



<Info >For Next.Js Page Router below 13.1, the [next-transpile-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules) should be used in the next.config.js.</Info>

```ts next.config.js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@trigger.dev/react']);

module.exports = withTM({});

```

## Run your Next.js site

Make sure your Next.js site is running locally, we will connect to it to register your Jobs.

<Warning>You must leave this running for the rest of the steps.</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn run dev
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run the CLI `dev` command

The CLI `dev` command allows the Trigger.dev service to send messages to your Next.js site. This is required for registering Jobs, triggering them and running tasks. To achieve this it creates a tunnel (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) so Trigger.dev can send messages to your machine.

You should leave the `dev` command running when you're developing.

In a **new terminal window or tab** run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Experiencing an error? This could be due to middleware.">
Instructions of how to resolve any issues due to middleware [here](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/platforms/nextjs#middleware)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced: Run your Next.js server together with the CLI">
You can modify your `package.json` to run both the Next.js server and the CLI `dev` command together.

1. Install the `concurrently` package:

  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn add concurrently --dev
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Modify your `package.json` file's `dev` script.

```json package.json
...
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently --kill-others npm:dev:*",
  "dev:next": "next dev",
  "dev:trigger": "npx @trigger.dev/cli dev",
  ...
}
...
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your first job

The CLI init command created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `api/trigger/route.ts` or `pages/api/trigger.ts`.

In there is this Job:

```typescript
//Job definition â€“ uses the client
client.defineJob({
  // 1. Metadata
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  // 2. Trigger
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  // 3. Run function
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // do something
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

If you navigate to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:

![Your first Job](/images/first-job.png)

## Triggering the Job

There are two way to trigger this Job.

1. Use the "Test" functionality in the dashboard.
2. Use the Trigger.dev API (either via our SDK or a web request)

### "Testing" from the dashboard

Click into the Job and then open the "Test" tab. You should see this page:

![Test Job](/images/test-job.png)

This Job doesn't have a payload schema (meaning it takes an empty object), so you can simple click the "Run test" button.

Congratulations, you should get redirected so you can see your first Run!
